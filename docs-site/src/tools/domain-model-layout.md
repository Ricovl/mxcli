# Domain Model Layout

A domain model generated from an MDL script has to be *placed* somewhere, and
MDL says nothing about placement unless you write `@position` on every entity.
`mxcli layout` arranges a module from its association graph, so you do not have
to.

```bash
mxcli layout -p app.mpr --module Sales --dry-run   # list the moves
mxcli layout -p app.mpr --module Sales             # apply them
mxcli layout -p app.mpr                            # every module the project owns
```

## What it does

Entities are layered on the associations between them:

- an entity that references nothing else in the module is a **lookup**, and goes
  in the leftmost column;
- everything else sits one column past the furthest thing it references;
- entities with **no association at all** — non-persistent helpers, mostly — go
  in a band underneath, rather than being mixed in with the lookups.

Association lines then mostly run one way instead of crossing the diagram.

On a real 16-entity model the layering falls out of the associations with no
hints:

| column | entities |
|---|---|
| 1 | `Department`, `EmploymentType`, `MovementReason`, `PlanType`, `PlanningYear`, `Region` |
| 2 | `Team`, `GoalBucket` |
| 3 | `GoalChange`, `GoalRegionValue`, `PlanScope`, `CapTrackUser` |
| 4 | `Employee`, `ScopeMonth` |
| 5 | `EmployeeMonth`, `Movement` |

## It replaces positions you set by hand

This is the reason it is a command you run rather than something `exec` does on
its own. Inside the modules it touches, every entity is repositioned — including
any you arranged yourself in Studio Pro. Use `--dry-run` first; it prints every
move as `Module.Entity (x, y) -> (x, y)` and writes nothing.

To repair a model you arranged by hand, use `--only-overlapping` instead: an
entity whose box does not collide with another entity or an annotation keeps its
position, and of two that collide the first in reading order (top to bottom,
then left to right) stays put while the other moves to the nearest free spot.
Annotations are obstacles and never move.

```
$ mxcli layout -p app.mpr --module Sales --only-overlapping --dry-run
  Sales.Small7  (100, 380) -> (100, 480)
Sales: 1 of 7 entities would move
```

Studio Pro does not store an entity's size, so box sizes are estimated from the
entity's name and attribute count, generously.

Marketplace modules and `System` are never touched. Naming one explicitly is an
error rather than a silent skip:

```
$ mxcli layout -p app.mpr --module Administration
Administration comes from the Marketplace, and a module update replaces it —
pass --include-marketplace to lay it out anyway
```

## Running it more than once

Positions are a function of the model alone, so the command is safe to leave in
a build script:

- **Idempotent.** A second run reports `already laid out` and does not write, so
  it produces no version-control noise.
- **Local.** Adding an entity and re-running moves only what the new
  relationships require — measured at 3 of 17 for one added entity with one
  association, not a reshuffle of the diagram.

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--module <name>` | Lay out this module (repeatable). Default: every module the project owns. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the moves, write nothing. |
| `--only-overlapping` | Move only entities that overlap another entity or an annotation; keep every other position. |
| `--include-marketplace` | Also lay out Marketplace modules. A module update replaces them, so this is normally pointless. |

## When you do want explicit positions

`@position(x, y)` on `CREATE ENTITY`, and `ALTER ENTITY … SET POSITION (x, y)`
to move one afterwards, both still work — and `describe entity` emits the stored
position, so arranging a model and describing it back is a way to capture a
layout into MDL.

Two things to know if you place entities yourself:

- The coordinate is the box's **top-left corner**, not its centre.
- An entity created with no position takes the next free slot in a wrapping
  grid — the first slot where its box, at its estimated height, clears every
  entity and annotation already in the module. That is a default, not a
  layout: it keeps a large model on screen and stops boxes overlapping, but it
  knows nothing about which entities are related. View entities, OData external
  entities and entities imported from a contract are placed the same way.

## Default position for an entity with no `@Position`

A wrapping grid (`mdl/dmlayout`), not the single 6,000px row it used to be.
