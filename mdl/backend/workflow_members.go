// different element type per activity kind (the metamodel types it:
// UserTaskOutcome on a user task, ParallelSplitOutcome on a parallel split,
// ConditionOutcome on a decision or a call microflow), so an op that addresses
// one kind's list must not be let loose on another's: ako/mxcli#415 wrote the
// wrong element type (a project Mendix cannot load), and ako/mxcli#791 read
// `path 1` as "the first outcome" of a user task and deleted it.
