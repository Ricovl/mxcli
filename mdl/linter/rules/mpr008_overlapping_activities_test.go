// upstream #884. MPR008 flattened a loop's children into the same list as the
// microflow's own canvas and compared every pair. A LoopedActivity's children are
// positioned RELATIVE to the container, so that compares two different coordinate
// spaces and reports overlaps that cannot happen on screen.
//
// Verified against a real project before and after: an outer activity at
// (150,150) and a loop child at (141,130) were reported as overlapping by the
// pre-fix binary and are not by the fixed one, while a genuine same-canvas pair
// at (300,200)/(310,210) is still reported by both.
