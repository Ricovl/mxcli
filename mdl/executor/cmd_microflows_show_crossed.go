// Mode 2 of PROPOSAL_structured_microflow_description.md: describe a graph whose
// branches CROSS faithfully, instead of flattening it into MDL that means
// something else.
//
// Phase E made an error path's rejoin sayable (`merge`/`join`). This says the
// other half with the same vocabulary: an inner split's branch landing where an
// outer split's branch lands — the shape no nesting of `if` reproduces, and the
// one #923 was actually reported for.
//
// # Why a crossed merge is handled the opposite way from a rejoin merge
//
// Both get a label, but they are emitted differently, and getting this backwards
// produces MDL that does not parse:
//
//   - An ERROR-REJOIN merge is declared INLINE where the traversal meets it
//     (traverseFlowUntilMerge does this), because the normal path owns it and
//     only the handler needs to name it.
//   - A CROSSED merge is reached by two or more BRANCHES of the same split. It
//     can be declared only once, so each branch ends in `join <label>` and stops,
//     and the declaration is emitted at the split's own level once both branches
//     are closed.
//
// That is why crossedMerges is a separate set rather than more entries in the
// same map: the label alone does not say which of the two emissions applies.

// or a boolean variable the user never wrote; `merge`/`join` can express the
// graph, but the describer's branch structure cannot be built from one entry, so
// they keep MDL-FLOW01 and are left alone rather than half-described.
