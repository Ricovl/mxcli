// Which entity a pluggable widget's attribute property binds against — the ONE
// rule `exec` writes by and `check` judges by (ako/mxcli#647).
//
// Studio Pro's rule is the widget's own. widget.xml's `dataSource="…"` on a
// property names the datasource whose ITEMS it binds to; a property WITHOUT one
// binds to the widget's context object, which is the nearest enclosing data
// container's entity. The engine used to answer "whichever datasource mapping
// ran last" for the second kind — and, in its explicit-key pass, for the first
// kind as well — so on mxcli-demo-2's VoxelViewer (two datasources, inside a
// data view) every unqualified attribute, the data view's own included, was
// written against the LAST datasource's entity: check clean, ten CE1613 in
// mx check.
//
// Keeping the rule here, as a function of plain data, is what lets the check
// share it: the executor feeds it the engine's live state, the validator the
// statically-known one, and neither re-derives it (see
// docs-wiki/bug-patterns/duplicate-resolver-drift.md).
