// # One control-flow form for both sides of a diff (ako/mxcli#859)
//
// diff-then-patch matches the statements a script declares against the stored
// flow's description. MDL can spell one graph more than one way, and describe
// prints the stored graph in only one of them, so a script that states the
// graph mxcli itself built from it could fail to match its own flow: under
// mdl 0 that fell back to a silent rebuild, under mdl 1 to a refusal of an
// identical re-run. canonicalFlow rewrites both sides into one form before
// they are compared, for each pair of spellings that build the same graph:
//
//   - A guard clause and an if/else whose then-branch ends the path.
//     `if c then …return; end if; rest` and `if c then …return; else rest end if`
//     build the same split: the then-branch ends, so there is no merge, and the
//     false flow leads to rest. describe prints the else form when the false
//     flow goes straight to an end event (a guard directly before the final
//     return) and the guard form otherwise. The canonical form is the guard
//     form: the else statements follow the if in the enclosing list, where
//     each is still located by its @position and stays addressable.
//
//   - A `join L` directly followed by its own `merge L`, where nothing else
//     joins L. Falling through into a merge and joining it are the same flow,
//     and a merge only one path reaches is no join point at all: describe
//     prints the pair for a nested guard whose false flow shares the outer
//     `if`'s merge (the merge is the `if`'s own, stated by its @merge), and no
//     author writes it. Both statements are dropped.
//
// Only where a path ends and how paths meet are rewritten; every statement
// that stands for a stored activity keeps its annotations, so the stored side
// still locates each by its @position. The rewrite copies what it changes: the
// declared statements are the ones the mdl 0 rebuild may still build from.
