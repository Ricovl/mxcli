// # One verdict for a `create or modify` of a stored flow
//
// exec, diff and check each answer "what happens to this statement?" for a
// `create or modify microflow|nanoflow` of a flow that is stored, and they must
// give the same answer (ako/mxcli#839, ako/mxcli#876). diff once said
// "unchanged" for a statement exec refused; check said nothing at all for
// statements exec refused under mdl 1, so a corpus migrated with
// `fmt --upgrade --header` checked clean and then stopped executing.
//
// decideFlowModify is that answer, computed once; exec acts on it
// (modifyFlowInPlace), diff reports it (spliceVerdict) and check reports it
// (checkFlowModify, cmd_check_flow_verdict.go). The wording of a refusal and
// of the mdl 0 rebuild warning is shared too, so check quotes exec.

// flowVerdict is what exec does with a `create or modify` of a flow.
// Exactly one of the cases holds:
//
//   - plan != nil: the change is spliced into the stored flow (an empty patch
//     writes nothing);
//   - why != nil: the splice cannot make it, and exec refuses the statement
//     under mdl 1 or rebuilds the whole flow under mdl 0 (refused says which);
//   - err != nil: the statement fails on its own account, under every
//     version;
//   - none of them: there is no such flow (or module) yet, so it is a create.
