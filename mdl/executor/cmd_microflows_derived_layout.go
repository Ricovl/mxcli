// A canonical DESCRIBE emits what the author wrote and nothing else (R12,
// ADR-0010). For a flow's layout that means: a position, anchor or curve the
// layout engine would produce on its own is DERIVED and is left out; one it
// would not produce was placed by someone and is kept. @start has worked this
// way since #951; this extends the rule to @position, @merge, @anchor and
// @curve.
//
// "Would the engine produce it" is not answered by comparing a coordinate with a
// formula. The engine places each statement relative to the one before it, so
// whether a node's position is derivable depends on which of its predecessors
// are pinned. The question is answered the only way that cannot drift from the
// engine: describe the flow with a candidate set of annotations, build it again
// exactly as `create or modify` would — nothing is written — and compare the
// result with the stored flow, node by node. A node that lands somewhere else
// gets its annotation back, and the round repeats until nothing moves.
//
// So the guarantee is by construction: when the loop ends, executing the
// description reproduces every stored position, anchor and curve that the full
// description reproduced. Omitting an annotation can never move a node, which
// is the property a Studio Pro-drawn flow needs — its layout is authored, and
// re-executing its description must leave it where the person put it.
//
// Anything that stops the check — a description that does not parse back, a
// rebuild that fails or does not pair with the stored graph, a loop that does
// not settle — keeps every annotation, which is the pre-#748 description.

// flowLayoutKeep is the set of layout annotations a canonical DESCRIBE keeps.
