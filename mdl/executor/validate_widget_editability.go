// Check-time validation for the `editable:` widget property.
//
// Mendix models editability on INPUT widgets only. Measured against
// generated/metamodel (the arbiter per CLAUDE.md), exactly eleven Pages types
// carry Editability / ConditionalEditabilitySettings — ten input widgets plus
// DataView — and not one of the fourteen button types does. A button has
// visibility, not editability.
//
// mxcli accepted `editable:` on any widget because the allow-lists behind
// MDL-WIDGET01 and MDL-WIDGET07 are widget-type-AGNOSTIC: isBuiltinPropName
// answers "is this a real MDL property name anywhere", and both validators read
// it as "is this valid on THIS widget". So `editable:` on a button passed check,
// passed exec, wrote nothing, and the button stayed enabled — a silent
// functional failure rather than a caught error. (issue #928)

// That is a different property from the one above, with a different meaning, and
// conflating the two was ako/mxcli#510. Pages$ListView.Editable makes the input
// widgets INSIDE the list view editable; Pages$GridColumn.Editable does the same
// for a column's cell. mxcli writes both — buildListViewV3 sets it, `describe
// page` reads it back, and mxbuild accepts the result at 0 errors on 11.12.2 —
// so warning that they are "silently dropped" was false, and told authors to
// stop setting the one property that makes an authored list view's inputs
// editable at all. buildListViewV3's own comment records how that failure looks:
// every input rendered as `<div class="form-control-static">`, with entity
// access ReadWrite and `mx check` clean.
//
// Only the PLAIN form is written. Neither type has ConditionalEditabilitySettings,
// so `editable: [expr]` on one is genuinely dropped and still earns MDL-WIDGET20
// — which is why this is a separate set rather than more entries in the one
// above.
//
// Kept in sync with generated/metamodel by TestPlainEditableBoolTypesMatchMetamodel,
// the sibling of TestEditableWidgetTypesMatchMetamodel. The older test could not
// have caught #510: it enumerates types carrying Editability, and these carry
// none, so they were invisible to it.

// in the statement. A warning rather than an error, matching MDL-WIDGET07 — the
// same "silently dropped on write" family, and the same reason (a hard reject on
// a vocabulary that cannot be proven complete risks false positives).
//
// Pluggable widgets are excluded. Whether one has editability is its package's
