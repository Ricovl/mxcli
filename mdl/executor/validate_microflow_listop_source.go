// checkListOperationSource flags a list-operation or aggregate whose list
// operand is not a variable — MDL-LISTOP02, mendixlabs/mxcli#1101.
//
// MDL's expression grammar makes list operations look composable:
//
//	$n = count(filter($reqs, $currentObject/Status = Mod.E.Approved));
//
// Mendix's model is not. Each of those is a separate ACTIVITY, and an activity
// stores its list as a variable reference — Microflows$AggregateAction's
// AggregateVariableName, Microflows$ListOperationsAction's list property. There
// is no slot for a nested computation, so the inner call had nowhere to go and
// was dropped, list and predicate together. The activity was then written with
// an empty list, which is the defect's whole signature: `check` clean, `exec`
// printing "Created microflow", and the failure only at build time.
//
// Measured on mxbuild 11.6.6, one microflow per project:
//
//	count(filter(…))       CE0012 "The 'List' property is required."
//	head(filter(…))        CE0096, the list-operation flavour of the same
//	sum(filter(…), 1)      CE0012 + CE0117
//	sort(filter(…), Name)  mxbuild ABORTS — InvalidOperationException on the
//	                       sort attribute, which resolves against the (now
//	                       absent) list's entity. No error code, no line: the
//	                       document cannot be loaded at all.
//	count('nonsense')      CE0012 — nesting is not required to lose the list
//
// The control for all of them is the reporter's own workaround, which builds
// the same two activities explicitly and passes at 0 errors.
//
// Retired for `mdl 1;` scripts (#733): there a list operation is one statement
// per activity whose operand is a VARIABLE, so a nested call does not parse and
// the visitor refuses the call forms that could nest (MDL-V1-LIST). This rule is
// reachable only from mdl 0 scripts, and goes with them.
//
// Why refuse rather than materialise an implicit variable: the refusal covers
// every spelling from one rule, including the literal operand, which no amount
// of materialising would fix. And it needs no project — the answer is in the
// statement's own text — so plain `mxcli check` reports it.
