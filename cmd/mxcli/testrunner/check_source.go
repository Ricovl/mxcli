// Rendering a .test.mdl file as something `mxcli check` and the LSP can check.
//
// A test file is not a sequence of top-level MDL statements. Each block is a
// MICROFLOW BODY — that is literally what the runner turns it into — so feeding
// one to the top-level grammar produces errors about the grammar rather than
// about the file. Measured on the block in mendixlabs/mxcli#1103: `DECLARE` is
// not a statement, the parser resyncs, `RETRIEVE` is swallowed as a non-reserved
// keyword, and the remaining `FROM …` starts an OQL query whose follow set is
// {GROUP_BY, SELECT, HAVING}. The reader is then told their RETRIEVE needs a
// SELECT — on a statement `mxcli syntax microflow.retrieve` prints as its own
// example.
//
// That is not a niche path. The VS Code extension binds the MDL language to
// `.mdl`, which `.test.mdl` matches, so every test file open in the editor was a
// wall of red squiggles; 9 of the 10 test files in this repository report errors
// this way, one of them 392.
//
// The rendering keeps every body on the line the author wrote it on, by padding
// with blank lines and putting the wrapper on the lines the doc comment and the
// '/' separator occupied. A diagnostic then needs no remapping — which is what
// makes this a translation of the source rather than a second parser for it.
