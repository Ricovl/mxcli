// Studio Pro open-project guard (mendixlabs/mxcli#849).
//
// Studio Pro keeps the model in memory and does not reload it when another
// process changes the files. A write mxcli makes while the project is open is
// silently discarded the next time Studio Pro saves: the write succeeds, `mx
// check` passes, and the change is gone. So every write that would reach storage
// is refused while Studio Pro has the project open, unless the caller opted out
// (exec --force, or MXCLI_ALLOW_STUDIO_PRO_OPEN=1). Reads are never refused, and
// a write that reconciliation elides as a no-op never gets here, so re-running a
// script that is already applied keeps working.
//
// The signal is the lock file Studio Pro creates beside the .mpr while the
// project is open and removes on close: `<project>.mpr.lock`. Studio Pro's own
// generated .gitignore lists it (with the project name LOWER-cased — TestApp's
// says `testapp.mpr.lock` beside `TestApp.mpr`), so the name is matched without
// regard to case. A Studio Pro that crashed leaves the file behind; the message
// says so and how to proceed, because failing toward noise is the point — the
// failure this guards against is silent.

// AllowWritesWhileStudioProOpen disables the guard for this process. It is the
// `--force` of the CLI; nothing sets it implicitly.
