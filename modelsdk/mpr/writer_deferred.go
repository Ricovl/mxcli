// Deferred unit writes: a run of statements that each rewrite the same unit is
// judged by where the run ENDS, not by every step on the way.
//
// # Why
//
// Each write is reconciled against what is on disk at the moment it lands
// (ADR-0008). That is the right question for one statement and the wrong one for
// a sequence whose steps undo each other. The measured case is a "reset, then
// authoritative grants" section (ako/mxcli#872, rehearsal W3):
//
//	revoke all on entity M.E from M.R;
//	grant read *, write * on entity M.E to M.R;
//
// The revoke removes the rule and is written; the grant builds the rule afresh
// and is written against a unit that no longer has it, so there is nothing to
// carry the old rule's $IDs from. Net: the domain model is rewritten on every
// run, the rule re-minted, the project's transaction id moved — although the
// rules it ends with are the ones it started with.
//
// # How
//
// While deferral is on, a unit update is held in memory instead of reaching
// storage, and the reader serves the held bytes (GetRawUnitBytes and the unit
// listings alike), so every later read in the run sees the run's own writes. On
// flush each held unit goes through updateUnit once, and is reconciled against
// what was on disk BEFORE the run: a run that nets to nothing is elided like any
// other no-op, and one that changes something carries the stored identities onto
// what it writes.
//
// Only updates are held. An insert or a delete is not something a later
// statement of the run can undo into a no-op, and deleting a unit drops its held
// write. The caller decides what forms a run and must flush before anything that
// writes through another path (see executor.accessRuleRun).
